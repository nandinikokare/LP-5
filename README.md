If TensorFlow is not installed:

Verify if TensorFlow is installed by running:
pip show tensorflow

If not installed, install it using:

nginx

pip install tensorflow
Incorrect TensorFlow version:

If TensorFlow is installed but the error persists, it might be due to a version issue. TensorFlow 2.x integrates Keras as tensorflow.keras, but in TensorFlow 1.x, Keras is a separate library.

Ensure you have TensorFlow 2.x installed:

pip install --upgrade tensorflow

Environment issues:
If you are using Jupyter Notebook, ensure that the kernel environment matches the TensorFlow environment. You can verify the Python environment in the notebook by running:

python
!which python
!pip show tensorflow

Kernel Restart:
After installing TensorFlow, restart the Jupyter kernel to apply changes.

ImportError: DLL load failed while importing defs: The specified procedure could not be found.

âœ… Steps to Resolve:
1. Reinstall h5py and tensorflow:
Run these commands to reinstall h5py and tensorflow:

bash
pip uninstall h5py tensorflow -y
pip install h5py tensorflow

3. Check for DLL Compatibility:
Ensure that the required DLLs are present in your Python environment. You can verify this by running:

bash
where h5py.dll
where hdf5.dll
If they are missing, reinstall h5py as shown above.

3. Update Anaconda Packages:
If you are using Anaconda, run:

bash
Copy code
conda update conda
conda update --all
4. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:
Ensure that the latest version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is installed. Download it from:
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

5. Check Python Version Compatibility:
Ensure that the TensorFlow version is compatible with your Python version. You can check your Python version using:

bash
python --version
If the Python version is too old or too new, consider creating a new environment with a compatible version:

bash
conda create -n tf_env python=3.10
conda activate tf_env
pip install tensorflow h5py
After completing these steps, restart Jupyter Notebook and run the code again. Let me know how it goes!
